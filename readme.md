### bongular

The Bowdoin Orient's frontend website, hosted at [bowdoinorient.com](bowdoinorient.com).

This app builds off the Orient's previous all-in-one website/CMS, the Bowdoin Orient Network Update System (BONUS) and utilizes the AngularJS framework (hence, Bongular).

#### setup

1. Clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/BowdoinOrient/bongular.git`
2. Install nodejs if you don't have it via [`brew`](http://brew.sh/) or [your platform's installer](http://nodejs.org/download/)
3. Install the Compass gem: `gem install compass`

#### environment

Bongular uses Grunt and Bower to manage dependencies and assets. You don't need to install them, their binaries are included in the repo.

To run bongular, execute `grunt serve` from the root of the repository.

#### tests

are on travis and I will add the badge here when I get around to it
